# PortfolioV1
"PortfolioV1... As you would have probably guessed by the title itself, it will be my first attempt to create a portfolio using only HTML and CSS, without any other framework. Even though this will basically be a prototype, I am determined to invest a substantial amount of time and effort to make it the best representation of my work.

By developing this portfolio, I aim to showcase my skills, projects, and achievements in a visually appealing and user-friendly manner. It will serve as a platform for potential clients and employers to explore my work and get a glimpse of my capabilities. I believe that by relying solely on HTML and CSS, I will gain a deeper understanding of web development principles and enhance my proficiency in these fundamental technologies.
